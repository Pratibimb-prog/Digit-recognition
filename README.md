# Digit-recognition
Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This project implements a digit classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights
Built a CNN model to classify digits (0-9) with high accuracy.

Enhanced generalization through data augmentation (random flip, rotation, fill_mode='nearest') and dropout regularization.

Achieved:

âœ… 99.42% training accuracy

âœ… 98.84% test accuracy

Prevented overfitting using early stopping and validation monitoring.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
MNIST handwritten digit dataset.

60,000 training images, 10,000 test images.

Grayscale images of size 28x28.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualization)
